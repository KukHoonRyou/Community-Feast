      <h1>About Community Feast</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Community Feast! Our mission is to reduce food waste and provide a platform where community members can share food with each other. Whether you have extra food to give away or are looking for something to eat, Community Feast is here to help.
      </p>
      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>For Donors (Eats):</strong> If you have food to share, simply post a description and picture of the food along with the location and availability times. Other community members can then view and reserve the food.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>For Receivers (Dibs):</strong> Browse the available food listings and reserve what you need. You can then arrange to pick it up at the specified location and time.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to create a sustainable community where food is shared and valued, reducing waste and helping those in need. We believe in the power of community and the positive impact of sharing resources.
      </p>
